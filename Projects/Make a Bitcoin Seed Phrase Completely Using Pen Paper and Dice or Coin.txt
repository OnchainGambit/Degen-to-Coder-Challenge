Steps Summary :-

1. Generate Seed Phrase in Binary

	Get a Pen, Paper and Coin Flip it, if heads 1 if tails 0
	Generate for 23 rows with each row having 11 turns/columns.
	And only 3 for 24th row. We need 8 more bits to get the 24th word.

2. Generating 24th Word

	We will basically generate a string using hashing of sha sum 256 algo
	Go to any Terminal of linus or mac type
	echo [All Your Binary Bits] | shasum -a 256 -0
	This will Generate a string, take the first 2 chars of it
	Convert each char from Hexadecimal to Binary, concat that to 3 bits of 24th word

3. Convert Binary to Decimal for Each Row

4. Get the BIP-39 word corresponding the Decimal
	Add 1 to the decimal as you can even get 0 but the list starts
	with 1.
